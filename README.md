# Advent Of Code 2023

For every day this year imma try to do it in:
- a python oneliner
- one other language such as rust, cpp, go, typescript etc.

To run any of the oneliners, put an `input.txt` (and optionaly a `test.txt`) in the same directory as the file. Also copy `loader.py` from `src/templates/loader.py` and put that in the directory.
